Welcome to my portfolio! Thanks to Connor for providing me the boilerplate for this so I can build on top of it. 
I'm still learning frontend design, as I specialize more in backend and cyber-threat analysis and research.
Hope you find it cool, though!

Follow me on here and researchgate--where I release my research papers. I'm working on a page where I release them though, as I am not a big fan of researchgate's UI.

Have a great one!
