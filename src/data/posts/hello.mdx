Hi! Welcome to my blog, my name is Halil, but you can call me Connor. I'm a student and a developer. I'm currently learning things like web and software development.
I'm also pretty interested in Photography, one of my favorite things to take a photo of is the moon.
Here's a photo of the moon I took a few days ago:

*Looks pretty cool, right?*
