I started by learning how to design basic websites before progressing to more complicated programming concepts. Initially, I learned on my own utilizing tools such as Codecademy, StackOverflow, and Udemy. I decided to pursue coding as a career after seeing how much I like the problem-solving aspect as I learnt more and created more projects. I am constantly improving my skills and discovering new technology.",
